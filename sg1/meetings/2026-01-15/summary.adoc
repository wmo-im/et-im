== Discussion Summary

=== 1. Background on Definitions

David provided background on the regulatory nature of definitions in technical regulations, referencing WMO document 1127 (Rules for Drafting Technical Regulations and Manuals). Key points:

* Definitions have the same regulatory status as the provisions in which the defined terms are used
* Only terms used in the manual's provisions should be included in the definitions section
* Terms not used in provisions could potentially be included in a future guide document

=== 2. GitHub for Issue Tracking

The team has started using GitHub for:

* Meeting notes (stored as AsciiDoc files in branches, approved via pull requests)
* Issue tracking for document review tasks
* Asynchronous discussion between meetings

The repository is public (viewable by all), but contributors need a GitHub account to comment on issues. Team members who cannot or prefer not to use GitHub directly can email comments to David for inclusion.

=== 3. Review of Removed Definitions

The team reviewed definitions that had been identified as unused in the manual:

==== 3.1 Definitions to Retain

* **Centennial Observing Station** - Chapter 5 covers station recognition for long-term observing stations. William will review the existing text to ensure the term is properly referenced.

* **Climatological day** - William requested retention pending review against the handbook.

==== 3.2 Definitions to Remove

* **Attribution day** - Work in progress, not currently used

* **Climate domain terms** (climate change, climate index, climate indicator, climate model, climate predictions, climate products, climate projections, climate simulation) - These relate to the broader climate domain and are not referenced in this edition. Could be included when the manual's scope is broadened in a future edition, or in a guide document.

* **Climatological station types** (ordinary, principal, reference climatological station) - Reference climatological station is used in the Manual on WIGOS, not this manual.

* **Data lifecycle terms** (data access, data analysis, data archival, data documentation, data exchange, data sharing, data governance, data integration, data integrity, data interoperability, data portability, data preservation, data quality terms) - Many are defined in the Guide to Information Management (WMO-No. 1061), which is already referenced in the manual. Peng will cross-reference against the stewardship maturity matrix.

* **Crowdsourced data** - Not used; externally sourced data is in the document. William suggested keeping only externally sourced data if one is needed.

* **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)** - Not used in current text. WMO uses URI for identifiers; DOI is one of many URI schemes.

* **Granular data, Network metadata** - Not used

* **Provenance metadata** - Simplified to just "provenance" in the text

==== 3.3 Discussion on Appendix for Unused Terms

A discussion arose about whether to include commonly used but undefined terms in an appendix. Charlotte raised concerns about scope creep and questioned the practical purpose. The team agreed to follow the principle in WMO-1127: only include terms that have regulatory implications through use in provisions.

=== 4. Workplan to End of March

The team agreed on a biweekly meeting structure:

* **Week 1**: Small core team meets to draft text and propose resolutions
* **Week 2**: Full subgroup reviews and reaches consensus on proposed changes

Goals:

* Complete definition review
* Have a good draft ready by end of March for external review by SC-MMO and SC-CLI, plus others.
* Tom Kralidas (Chair, Expert Team on Metadata) will present on the WMO Core Metadata Profile in February - this is relevant to both subgroups regarding potential climate extensions to discovery metadata

=== 5. Other Business

* William will be unavailable for 1-2 meetings in February (travel to Fiji with Bureau's COSPAC project)
* David has shared the draft Manual, including the Part II on marine cliamte data, with Secretariat colleagues
supporting SC-MMO, plus Peng, Alvaro and Axel from this team.
* Team members encouraged to engage with GitHub between meetings rather than waiting for meetings to raise issues

== Decisions

* Retain "Centennial Observing Station" and "Climatological day" definitions pending text review
* Remove climate modelling/projection terms (not used in this edition)
* Do not create a separate appendix for unused terms - follow WMO-1127 principle
* Adopt GitHub for issue tracking and meeting notes
* Implement biweekly meeting structure alternating between drafting team and full subgroup
