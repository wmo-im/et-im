= ET-IM-SG2 23rd January 2026 Teleconference

23 January 2026 12:00 - 13:30 UTC

== 1. Participants

*Chair:* Ian Edwards

*Participants:* Ge Peng, Liu Yiming, Dwayne Scott, Etna Cervantes

*Secretariat:* David Berry

*Apologies:* Xavier Perrot, Peter Thorne, Patrick Muimi, Denis Stuber

== 2. Summary

=== 2.1 Overview

This meeting focused on GitHub workflow familiarization, approval of previous meeting notes, a decision on the abstract
test suite, and planning for the document review process.

=== 2.2 Meeting Notes from 9th January

==== 2.2.1 Approval Process

* Ian demonstrated the GitHub pull request workflow for reviewing and merging meeting notes
* The team reviewed the pull request containing the January 9th meeting summary
* Previous review comments had been addressed and marked as resolved
* The meeting notes were approved and merged into the main repository

==== 2.2.2 Access and Workflow

* GitHub access via e-mail and Word documents will be provided for team members who cannot access GitHub
(e.g., due to network restrictions in some countries)
* Liu Yiming noted that GitHub access from China can be unreliable; suggestion to use both GitHub and e-mail together was accepted
* David confirmed he will send meeting notes as Word documents via e-mail going forward

=== 2.3 Abstract Test Suite Decision

==== 2.3.1 Discussion

* The team reviewed an example abstract test suite from the OGC API Common specification
* Ian explained the difference between abstract test suites (written specifications) and physical test suites (executable code)
* David noted that creating abstract tests requires finalized functional requirements first
* Ge Peng raised concern about team capacity to complete both requirements and test suite within timeline

==== 2.3.2 Decision

* *Decision:* The team agreed to postpone work on the abstract test suite and focus on finalizing the functional requirements document
* Rationale: Timeline constraints mean there is insufficient time to both finalize requirements and develop the test suite
* The abstract test suite can be addressed in future work after the document is submitted to INFCOM
* An example of abstract tests from the current requirements will be created to demonstrate what they would look like

=== 2.4 GitHub Workflow Training

==== 2.4.1 Demonstration

Ian provided a detailed walkthrough of:

* Navigating the ET-IM repository structure (SG1, SG2 directories)
* The difference between the ET-IM admin repository and the CDMS Functional Requirements document repository
* Creating and reviewing pull requests
* Making comments and suggestions on proposed changes
* Using the Issues tab to track tasks related to document chapters
* Using the Discussions tab for general conversations not tied to specific file changes
* Filtering issues by chapter labels
* Assigning reviewers to issues

==== 2.4.2 Repository Structure Clarification

* Two repositories are being used:
** `wmo-im/et-im`: For team administration (meeting notes, terms of reference)
** `wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements`: For the CDMS document development
* Issues for each chapter and each requirements class have been created in the document repository
* Team members can filter issues by chapter label to find relevant discussions

==== 2.4.3 GitHub Quick Start Guide

* Ge Peng requested a simple guide for team members unfamiliar with GitHub
* Ian agreed to create a Word document with screenshots explaining:
** How to register for GitHub
** How to navigate to the ET-IM and CDMS repositories
** How to propose changes to documents
** What to do if GitHub is inaccessible
* This guide will be shared with the entire ET-IM team

=== 2.5 Document Review Process

==== 2.5.1 Review Approach

* Team members should familiarize themselves with the entire document
* Identify sections of particular expertise or interest
* Focus detailed review on those specific sections
* Propose changes via GitHub pull requests
* Assign yourself to issues when reviewing specific sections

==== 2.5.2 Timeline

* First draft completion target: End of March / 1st April 2026
* Milestone wording will be updated to remove reference to abstract test suite

=== 2.6 PDF Generation and Repository Management

* Discussed the need for team members to access current PDF versions
* Acknowledged that the current approach of storing compiled PDFs in the repository may cause storage issues
* David and Ian to work on an improved workflow, potentially using GitHub Codespaces
* David will continue to provide Word versions of the document via e-mail

=== 2.7 Public Repository Note

* Liu Yiming asked about repository visibility
* Clarified that the repository is currently public - anyone can view the content
* All discussions and document history will eventually be publicly visible
* Ian will include a note about this in the GitHub guide

== 3. Key Decisions

* Abstract test suite work is postponed to focus on finalizing functional requirements
* Meeting notes will be distributed via both GitHub and e-mail (with Word attachment)
* A GitHub quick start guide will be created for the team
* Next meeting to be scheduled via Doodle poll for the week of 9th February (Tuesday preferred)
* Clause terminology from OGC ModSpec will be retained (not changed to "chapter")

== 4. Action Items

=== Ian Edwards

* Create a simple GitHub quick start guide (Word document with screenshots) for the ET-IM team
* Include information on: registering for GitHub, navigating repositories, proposing changes, and what to do if GitHub is inaccessible
* Include note about public visibility of repository content

=== David Berry

* Send meeting notes as Word documents via e-mail going forward
* Send Doodle poll for next meeting date (week of 9th February, Tuesday options preferred)
* Update milestone wording to remove abstract test suite reference

* Enable discussions tab on ET-IM repository
* Send Word version of the latest CDMS functional requirements document
* Discuss with Tom about creating a broader WMO guide for GitHub workflows (potential TT-OSS activity)

=== All Team Members

* Familiarize with the entire CDMS functional requirements document
* Identify sections of particular expertise or interest for detailed review
* Propose changes via GitHub where possible, or reply via e-mail if GitHub is inaccessible
* Assign yourself to issues when reviewing specific sections
