09 January 2026 12:00 – 13:30 UTC

== 1. Participants

*Chair:* Ian Edwards

*Participants:* Ge Peng, Patrick Muimi, Xavier Perrot, Peter Thorne, Denis Stuber

*Secretariat:* David Berry

== 2. Summary

=== 2.1 Overview

This meeting focused on reviewing the CDMS Functional Requirements document structure, establishing the review process, and confirming the timeline for finalization by mid-2026.

=== 2.2 Document Structure and Repository

==== 2.2.1 Repository Location and Workflow

* The functional requirements document is now hosted on GitHub in the WMO-IM organization: https://github.com/wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements
* Document source files are written in AsciiDoc format located in the 'standard' directory
* The latest version of the compiled PDF will be available in the 'compiled' directory
* PDF generation is currently manual but GitHub Actions automation is planned for automatic regeneration on merging of pull requests
* Team members are requested to provide their GitHub handles/IDs to David for repository access
* GitHub issues will be used to review and track changes to the document and to assign sections to team members
* GitHub discussions can also be used for more general discussions and questions

==== 2.2.2 Terminology Note

* Source files in the repository use "clause" terminology while the PDF output refers to "chapters"
* The numbering is consistent between both, so cross-referencing is straightforward
* David will check the origin of "clause" terminology (likely inherited from OGC ModSpec and its dependence on ISO standards)
* Renaming to "chapters" may be considered but is not a priority

==== 2.2.3 Key Updates

David Berry presented the following structural improvements:

*Standards Alignment*

* Document now follows OGC ModSpec standard for defining requirements and specifications
* Conformance classes defined for testing purposes

*Scope Expansion*

* Enhanced scope section with clearer context and boundaries
* Added system landscape and data flow diagrams showing:
** Field observations from meteorological sensors
** Data collection and processing systems
** Flow to operational systems (NWP)
** Flow to Climate Data Management System (CDMS)
** Flow to WIS 2.0 for international data exchange
* Explicit definitions of what is in-scope vs. out-of-scope

*In-Scope Elements*

* Quality control procedures specific to climate data requirements
* Long-term data consistency
* Homogenization processes
* Data rescue activities
* Station metadata management with focus on long-term consistency and provenance
* Archive and preservation of datasets
* Climate product generation
* Data sharing through WIS 2.0, national networks, and international archives
* Data lineage and provenance tracking

*Out of Scope Elements*

* Collection of observations from sensors
* Real-time data collection
* Time-critical data exchange
* NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) systems

*System Architecture*

* New diagrams showing key CDMS components:
** User interface and API layers
** Data ingestion systems
** QC engine
** Homogenization engine/services
** Metadata management
** Data stores
** External system interactions
* Note: Data collection and processing system positioning needs further work in diagrams

*Document Organisation*

* Functional requirements section
* Non-functional requirements section
* Test specifications (to be developed)
* Appendices (to be developed)
* Conformance chapter describing main conformance classes (to be developed)

=== 2.3 Document Audience Clarification

Ian raised a clarification about the document audience:

* The document should clarify it defines requirements for CDMS developers, not requirements for WMO Member States directly
* This is intended to assist developers and integrators, empowers users and assessors, enables interoperability
* Issue created on GitHub to clarify this distinction
* GitHub issue https://github.com/wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements/issues/3[wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements#3] created: "Chapter 1 - Clarify who the document is for and scope"

=== 2.4 Quality Control Discussion

Peter Thorne noted that some of the QC checks need to be conditional:

* QC checks (e.g., wet bulb vs dry bulb temperature) can only apply when both variables are observed
* Agreement that conditionals need to be added to requirements
* Team members encouraged to create GitHub issues with comments and proposed changes
* GitHub issue https://github.com/wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements/issues/4[wmo-im/cdms-functional-requirements#4] created: "Section 6.2.3 - make QC checks conditional."

=== 2.5 Certificate and Conformance Discussion

Peter Thorne raised a question on governance and confirmation that software meets the requirements:

* Who will certify/recognize that systems meet requirements?
* Concern: Requirements without means of recognition/certification are incomplete
* WMO should have mechanism to validate conformance

David Berry responded:

* Abstract conformance tests are planned to be included in document
* The Task team on Open Source Software (TT-OSS) is looking at this issue, but in a broader / more generic sense. Similar questions exist for other requirements (e.g. WIS, first mile data exchange)
* Issue is being addressed across multiple WMO initiatives
* Complete answer not yet available but actively being worked on

=== 2.6 Test Suite Discussion

==== 2.6.1 Abstract Test Suite Inclusion

* Document structure includes provision for test specifications
* Discussion on whether to include full abstract test suite given timeline constraints
* Ian noted: Time frame seems reasonable for finalizing document as-is, but needs more thought regarding full test suite inclusion

==== 2.6.2 Test Suite Clarifications

* Abstract test suite: Written specifications defining tests for conformance (not executable code)
* Physical test suite: Actual executable code that can be run to test software
* This document will focus on abstract test suite (written test specifications)
* Physical test suite (executable code) is out of scope for this timeline

==== 2.6.3 Action Item

David will provide example OGC documents showing:

* Documents with abstract test suites included
* How test specifications are written and structured
* This will help team understand what an abstract test suite looks like in written form

==== 2.6.4 Decision Point

* Question of whether document can stand alone without test suite or if it should be included
* Document could proceed without test suite, but including it would ensure requirements are implementable
* Team will revisit feasibility at next meeting (January 23rd) after seeing examples

=== 2.7 Review Process and Timeline

==== 2.7.1 Overall Timeline

* INFCOM 4 session: November 2026
* Final submission to INFCOM: Early September 2026
* Final draft ready: End of June 2026 (accounting for summer availability), external review over July and August
* Draft of all content (including abstract test suite): March/April 2026, ready for broader review.

==== 2.7.2 Review Process Phases

*Phase 1 (January - March): Internal Team Review*

* Team members review document in detail
* Identify sections requiring work
* Make necessary revisions
* Weekly or bi-weekly meetings as needed based on availability

*Phase 2 (April): Broader Community Review*

* Send draft to CDMS developers and wider WMO community
* Collect feedback and comments

*Phase 3 (May - June): Finalization*

* Address review comments
* Complete final revisions
* Prepare for INFCOM submission

==== 2.7.3 Immediate Review Period

All team members are asked to:

* Review the document thoroughly
* Familiarize themselves with the structure and content
* Identify areas where they can provide constructive feedback
* Note sections that need changes or clarification
* Be prepared to volunteer for leading specific section reviews

==== 2.7.4 Issue Tracking Approach

David will create GitHub issues for document management:

* One issue per chapter initially
* Sub-issues can be created for specific sections within chapters as discussions develop
* Issues will be used to assign reviewers to specific sections
* This approach avoids creating excessive tickets upfront while maintaining organization

== 3. Key Decisions

* Next meeting scheduled: Friday, January 23, 2026 at the same time (1200 – 1330 UTC)
* Meeting format: Continue with Friday meetings for this subgroup (recognizing some members unavailable, but they'll receive meeting notes)
* Review period: Two weeks from January 9th to January 23rd for initial document review
* David will send meeting invite and ask attendees to explicitly accept to confirm availability
* David will summarize this meeting and send to team along with link to GitHub repository
* Full ET-IM meeting discussion postponed until after January 23rd subgroup meeting
